Chemsmart is a python-based toolkit for the automatic creation of input and submission script files, the submission and
the analysis of quantum chemistry simulation jobs.

It uses the same submission command regardless of the queueing systems (SLURM, Torque or SLF) used by any High
Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

Users can customize their own HPC server settings and project settings to run different jobs, without modifying the
codes in this package.

            abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple â€˜for-loopâ€™ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}
